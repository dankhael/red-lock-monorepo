# Plan: Create CLAUDE.md

Create a single `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root with concise, non-obvious guidance for future Claude Code instances.

## Key sections to include:
- Project overview (Strapi 5 + CRA monorepo, npm workspaces)
- Node version requirement (<=22, use nvm)
- Dev/build/test commands (root-level and per-workspace)
- Architecture: content types, API services, routing, mock data system
- Environment setup (dual DB strategy, API tokens)
- Windows compatibility note (cross-env)

## File: `CLAUDE.md` (repo root)
